Things to do
Solve the "" problem ok
Organizations -> make sure there are no inconsistent data entries e.g the country ok, industries are standardized in the same format (E.g SouthKorea, South Korea) ok
checked for duplicate rows yes
Weird words- 4thgeneration, 5thgeneration, 6thgeneration knowledgebase need to change in notepad ++ editor
People - ph no. + and also the x.... and the fullstops in some of the numbers
figure out if postgres can import both a mix of quotation and non-quotations

Some analytical notes
None of the first and last names nor the emails match between the CSV's.
How should phone numbers be "cleaned"? When there are many different phone formats existing in the current csv

1. Create a cleaned PH data, and the unclean one beside it
1.1 Test out duplicates again
2. Use django to import the csv into postgres
3. Do CRUD using django and postgres
4. Make a front-end using vue.js
Prototype - User can upload a csv file and there must be a notif (upload success/ 8/10 imported and also error handling). 
It *CAN* show the completed file. The simple table must be shown when you type into search bar (e.g Zingapore) and this makes a fuzzy query to the customer table, and then export that filtered dataset out to csv.
5. create user stories
